Vanilla-Terraria-Server
Create Vanilla Terraria Server Docker image

## this is a work in progress as I learn docker. ##
## I will eventually move this process over to tshock ##
## Building a new docker image will download the current version the terraria-server.zip file from Terraria.org ##

# Build command:
docker build --tag Vanilla-Terraria --file Dockerfile .

# Run container in interactive mode.
docker run -it -p 7777:7777 --memory=2048m --mount type=volume,src=terraria,dst=/home/terraria/.local/share/Terraria --name="terraria" Vanilla-Terraria

# you can restart this container if it is stopped
docker start <containerâˆ’id>

## TO:DO ##
## Better documentation ##
## Better way to pass in variables from the docker run (ie world name, world location, world size on auto creation, player count..etc) ##
## Get image pushed to docker hub (don't currently have an account there yet) ##


## Special thanks to a few of the other people who have already solved this 'problem' in docker. looking at their Dockerfiles helped me out a lot; I mostly looked at https://github.com/JoshuaTheMiller/Vanilla-Terraria ##
